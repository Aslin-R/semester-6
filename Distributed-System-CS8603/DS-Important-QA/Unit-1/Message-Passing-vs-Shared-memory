Differences between message passing and shared memory systems:

|                  | Message Passing                     | Shared Memory                      |
|------------------|------------------------------------ |------------------------------------|
| Communication    | Send/receive messages               | Directly access shared variables    |
| Data Sharing     | No direct access to variables       | Directly share variables            |
| Address Space    | Private address space for processes | Shared memory accessed by all       |
| Compatibility    | Suitable for heterogeneous systems  | Not suitable for heterogeneous systems |
| Synchronization  | Message passing primitives          | Locks, semaphores, synchronization mechanisms |
| Execution Control| Processes execute simultaneously for message exchange | Non-overlapping lifetimes of processes |
| Efficiency       | Explicit communication, programmer aware of cost | Communication may be implicit, less visibility of cost |
| Scalability      | Suitable for distributed systems    | Efficient for closely located processes |
| Complexity       | Involves coordination and overhead  | Simpler communication with direct access to shared data |
