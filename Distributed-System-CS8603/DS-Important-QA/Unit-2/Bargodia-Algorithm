Bagrodia algorithm with processes as an example:

1. Receive commands are forever enabled from all processes.
2. Once a send command is enabled, it remains enabled until it completes. This means that a send command cannot be executed before the send is completed.
3. To prevent deadlock, process identifiers are used to introduce asymmetry and break potential crowns (cyclic blocking) that may arise.
4. Each process attempts to schedule only one send event at a time.

Now, let's go through the steps of the Bagrodia algorithm with a simple example involving three processes: P1, P2, and P3.

1. P1 wants to execute a SEND(M) to a lower priority process P2:
   - P1 executes the send(M) command and blocks until it receives an acknowledgment (ack(M)) from P2. The send event SEND(M) is now completed.
   - Any messages, let's say M', from higher priority processes and requests for synchronization (request(M')) from lower priority processes received during the blocking period are queued.

2. P1 wants to execute a SEND(M) to a higher priority process P3:
   (a) P1 seeks permission from P3 by executing send(request(M)):
       - This step helps to avoid deadlock situations where processes are cyclically blocked due to message exchanges.
   (b) While P1 is waiting for permission, it remains unblocked.
       - If a message M' arrives from a higher priority process, let's say P2, P1 accepts it by scheduling a RECEIVE(M') event and then sends an acknowledgment (ack(M')) back to P2.
       - If a request(M') arrives from a lower priority process, P1 executes send(permission(M')) to that process and blocks, waiting for the message M' to arrive. Once M' arrives, the RECEIVE(M') event is executed.
   (c) When the permission(M) message arrives, P1 knows that the partner process P3 is synchronized, and it executes send(M). The SEND(M) is now completed.

3. Request(M) arrival at P1 from a higher priority process P3:
   - When a request(M) is received by P1 from a higher priority process P3, P1 executes send(permission(M)) to P3 and blocks, waiting for the message M to arrive. Once M arrives, the RECEIVE(M) event is executed, and the process unblocks.

4. Message M arrival at P1 from a higher priority process P2:
   - When a message M is received by P1 from a higher priority process P2, P1 executes RECEIVE(M) (which is assumed to be always enabled) and then sends an acknowledgment (ack(M)) back to P2.

5. Processing when P1 is unblocked:
   - When P1 is unblocked, it dequeues the next message (if any) from the queue and processes it as a message arrival, following either rule 3 or 4.

This is a simplified explanation of the Bagrodia algorithm, illustrating the steps involved in message sending, receiving, and synchronization among processes. The algorithm helps ensure that messages are exchanged correctly and in a synchronized manner, preventing deadlocks and preserving the order of message delivery based on priority.
