Certainly! Let's consider an example with three processes in a distributed system: Process A, Process B, and Process C. These processes are connected by channels through which they can exchange messages.

1. Initially, all processes are in some state and have not recorded any snapshots.

2. Process A decides to initiate the snapshot process. It records its own state, let's say it has some variables x = 5 and y = 10.

3. After recording its state, Process A sends a marker message along its outgoing channels to Process B and Process C.

4. Upon receiving the marker from Process A, Process B checks if it has already recorded its state. Since it hasn't, it marks the channel from Process A to B as empty.

5. Similarly, Process C also marks the channel from Process A to C as empty since it hasn't recorded its state yet.

6. Process A, after sending the marker, can continue sending regular messages or perform other operations.

7. Meanwhile, Process B decides to initiate the snapshot process. It records its own state, let's say it has variables x = 7 and y = 15.

8. Process B then sends a marker along its outgoing channel to Process C.

9. Upon receiving the marker from Process B, Process C checks if it has already recorded its state. Since it hasn't, it marks the channel from Process B to C as empty.

10. Process B can continue its operations after sending the marker.

11. Finally, Process C decides to initiate the snapshot process. It records its own state, let's say it has variables x = 3 and y = 12.

12. Process C does not have any outgoing channels, so it doesn't need to send any markers.

13. Now, each process has recorded its own state, and the recorded states of the channels reflect the messages received after each process recorded its state and before it received any markers.

By following these steps, each process has taken a snapshot of its own state, and the states of the channels have been recorded accordingly. This allows for a consistent global snapshot of the distributed system to be reconstructed, capturing the state of each process and the messages exchanged between them at that particular moment.
