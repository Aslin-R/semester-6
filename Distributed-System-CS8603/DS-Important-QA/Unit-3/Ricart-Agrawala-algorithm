 Let's understand the Ricart-Agrawala algorithm with a simple example:

Imagine we have three sites (processes) in a distributed system: Site A, Site B, and Site C. These sites share a critical section of code that needs to be accessed mutually exclusively.

1. Requesting the critical section:
   - Let's say Site A wants to enter the critical section. It sends a REQUEST message to Sites B and C, indicating its timestamp (let's say timestamp A=1).
   - Site B and Site C receive the REQUEST message from Site A. Since they are not currently in the critical section, they both send a REPLY message back to Site A.

2. Executing the critical section:
   - Site A enters the critical section only when it has received a REPLY message from all other sites. In this case, it waits until it receives the REPLY from Site B and Site C.

3. Releasing the critical section:
   - After Site A finishes executing the critical section, it sends REPLY messages to Site B and Site C (if they had pending requests).
   - If Site B or Site C wants to enter the critical section later, they will need to go through the same process of sending REQUEST messages and receiving REPLY messages from other sites.

This algorithm ensures that only one site can be in the critical section at a time. It uses timestamps to determine the order of requests, and sites reply to requests based on their own state. If a site has a pending request, it defers the reply until it is in a suitable state.

By following these steps and exchanging REQUEST and REPLY messages, the Ricart-Agrawala algorithm guarantees mutual exclusion in accessing the critical section among distributed sites.
